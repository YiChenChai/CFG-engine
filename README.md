# Context Free Grammar Engine

This tool is a C++ library that can create a recursive-descent parser based on CFG syntax. It was made for fun after reading the book Object-Oriented Programming in C++ by Robert Lafore and subsequently getting exposed to compiler concepts in the Dragon book. 

Disclaimer: This was written as a practice and should not be used in any serious applications.

## Getting Started

g++ CFG.cpp yourfile.cpp -o yourbinary

### Prerequisites

No additional dependencies other that what C++ has to offer. A tool to render graphviz is needed to show the syntax tree.
